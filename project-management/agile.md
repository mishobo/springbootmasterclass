# Agile methodology
- Agile methodology is a project management framework that breaks projects down into several dynamic phases, commonly known as sprints
- Agile has a couple of frameworks ie Kanban, Scrum, Extreme Programming (XP), Adaptive Project Framework (APF), Extreme Project Management (XPM), Adaptive Software Development (ASD),
  Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM), Feature Driven Development (FDD). 
- The Agile framework is an iterative methodology. After every sprint, 
  teams reflect and look back to see if there was anything that could be improved so they can adjust their strategy for the next sprint.

1. Plan
2. Design
3. Develop
4. Test
5. Deploy
6. Review

# Scrum
* Scrum is a common Agile methodology for small teams and also involves sprints. 
  The team is led by a Scrum master whose main job is to clear all obstacles for others executing the day-to-day work.
* Scrum teams meet daily to discuss active tasks, roadblocks, and anything else that may affect the development team.
- Sprint planning: This event kicks off the sprint. Sprint planning outlines what can be delivered in a sprint (and how).
- Sprint retrospective: This recurring meeting acts as a sprint reviewâ€”to iterate on learnings from a previous sprint that will improve and streamline the next one.

# What is the Agile Manifesto?
- The Agile Manifesto is a document that focuses on four values and 12 principles for Agile software development. 
- It was published in February 2001 by 17 software developers who needed an alternative to the more linear product development process.  

# What are the 4 pillars of Agile?
1. Team collaboration over processes and tools.
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation:- The software that Agile teams develop should work. Additional work, like documentation, is not as important as developing good software.
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
4. Responding to change over following a plan.

# What are the 12 Agile principles?
1. Satisfy customers through early, continuous improvement and delivery.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in the project. 
3. Deliver value frequently.
4. Break the silos of your projects.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. 
6. The most effective way to communicate is face-to-face.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Maintain a sustainable working pace.
9. Continuous excellence enhances agility.
10. Simplicity is essential. Sometimes the simplest solution is the best solution. 
    Agile aims to not overcomplicate things and find simple answers to complex problems.
11. Self-organizing teams generate the most value.
12. Regularly reflect and adjust your way of work to boost effectiveness. (Retrospective meetings)

# What are the benefits of the Agile development methodology?
1. Adaptability:- the ability to shift strategies quickly, without disrupting the flow of a project. 
2. fosters collaborative teamwork
3. focuses on customer needs
