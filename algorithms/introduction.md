# Algorithms

Definition:
a procedure used for solving a problem or performing a computation.
A procedure for solving a mathematical problem in a finite number of steps that frequently involves recursive operations.
Therefore, Algorithm refers to a sequence of finite steps to solve a particular problem.
The Algorithm designed are language-independent, i.e. they are just plain instructions that can be implemented in any 
language, and yet the output will be the same, as expected.

input -> (a set of rules to obtain the expected output) algorithm -> output 

## Uses of the Algorithms
1. Computer Science: used to solve problems ranging from simple sorting and searching to complex tasks such as artificial
                     intelligence and machine learning.
2. Mathematics: Algorithms are used to solve mathematical problems, such as finding the optimal solution to a system of 
                linear equations or finding the shortest path in a graph.
3. Operations Research: Algorithms are used to optimize and make decisions in fields such as transportation, logistics, 
                        and resource allocation.
4. Artificial Intelligence: Algorithms are the foundation of artificial intelligence and machine learning, and are used 
                            to develop intelligent systems that can perform tasks such as image recognition, 
                            natural language processing, and decision-making.
5. Data Science: Algorithms are used to analyze, process, and extract insights from large amounts of data in fields such 
                 as marketing, finance, and healthcare.

### importance of algorithms
- Algorithms are necessary for solving complex problems efficiently and effectively.
- They help to automate processes and make them more reliable, faster, and easier to perform.
- Algorithms also enable computers to perform tasks that would be difficult or impossible for humans to do manually.
- They are used in various fields such as mathematics, computer science, engineering, finance, and many others to 
  optimize processes, analyze data, make predictions, and provide solutions to problems.
