### DNS Basics
All computers on the Internet, from your smartphone or laptop to the servers that serve content for massive retail websites, 
find and communicate with one another by using numbers. These numbers are known as IP addresses.
A DNS service such as Amazon Route 53 is a globally distributed service that translates human-readable names like www.example.com 
into the numeric IP addresses like 192.0.2.1 that computers use to connect to each other.
The Internet’s DNS system works much like a phone book by managing the mapping between names and numbers. 
DNS servers translate requests for names into IP addresses, 
controlling which server an end user will reach when they type a domain name into their web browser.
These requests are called queries.

# Types of DNS Service
- Authoritative DNS
- Recursive DNS
