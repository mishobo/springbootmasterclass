# Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort is an algorithm that sorts an array from the lowest value to the highest value.

How it works:
1. Go through the array, one value at a time.
2. For each value, compare the value with the next value.
3. If the value is higher than the next one, swap the values so that the highest value comes last.
4. Go through the array as many times as there are values in the array.

### Bubble Sort Time Complexity
The Bubble Sort algorithm loops through every value in the array, comparing it to the value next to it. 
So for an array of n values, there must be n such comparisons in one loop.

And after one loop, the array is looped through again and again n times.
This means there are n â‹… n comparisons done in total, so the time complexity for Bubble Sort is:
O(n^2)
