- Data Structures is about how data can be stored in different structures.
- Algorithms is about how to solve different problems, often by searching through and manipulating data structures.
- Theory about Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) helps us to use large amounts of data to solve problems efficiently.

### What are Data Structures?
- A data structure is a way to store data.
- We structure data in different ways depending on what data we have, and what we want to do with it.
- In Computer Science there are two different kinds of data structures.

1. Primitive Data Structures are basic data structures provided by programming languages to represent single values, 
   such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and booleans.
2. Abstract Data Structures are higher-level data structures that are built using primitive data types and 
   provide more complex and specialized operations. Some common examples of abstract data structures include arrays, 
   linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

### What are Algorithms?
An algorithm is a set of step-by-step instructions to solve a given problem or achieve a specific goal.
Algorithms are fundamental to computer programming as they provide step-by-step instructions for executing tasks.
An efficient algorithm can help us find the solution we are looking for, 
and to transform a slow program into a faster one.

Data structures and algorithms (DSA) go hand in hand. 
A data structure is not worth much if you cannot search through it or manipulate it efficiently using algorithms, 
and the algorithms in this tutorial are not worth much without a data structure to work on.

DSA is about finding efficient ways to store and retrieve data, to perform operations on data, and to solve specific problems.

By understanding DSA, you can:
* Decide which data structure or algorithm is best for a given situation. 
* Make programs that run faster or use less memory. 
* Understand how to approach complex problems and solve them in a systematic way.

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are used in virtually every software system, from operating systems to web applications:

* For managing large amounts of data, such as in a social network or a search engine.
* For scheduling tasks, to decide which task a computer should do first.
* For planning routes, like in a GPS system to find the shortest path from A to B.
* For optimizing processes, such as arranging tasks so they can be completed as quickly as possible.
* For solving complex problems: From finding the best way to pack a truck to making a computer 'learn' from data.

DSA is fundamental in nearly every part of the software world:
* Operating Systems
* Database Systems
* Web Applications
* Machine Learning
* Video Games
* Cryptographic Systems
* Data Analysis
* Search Engines
