- Spring Framework is a comprehensive and versatile platform for enterprise Java development.
- Spring is a lightweight and popular open-source Java-based framework developed by Rod Johnson in 2003.
- It is known for its Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI) capabilities 
  that simplify creating modular and testable applications.
- Key features include Spring MVC for web development, Spring Boot for rapid application setup, 
  and Spring Security for robust authentication and authorization. 
- The spring contains several modules like IOC, AOP, DAO, Context, WEB MVC, etc.

### Features of the Spring Framework
1. Inversion of Control (IoC) container
2. Data access framework
3. Spring MVC framework
4. Transaction management
5. Spring Web Service
6. JDBC abstraction layer
7. Spring TestContext framework


- The Spring framework consists of seven modules: 
1. Spring Core
2. Spring AOP
3. Spring Web MVC
4. Spring DAO
5. Spring ORM
6. Spring context
7. Spring web flow

### 1. Spring Core module
- provides the IoC container
- There are two types of implementations of the Spring container, namely, bean factory and application context. 
- Bean factory is defined using the org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanFactory interface and acts as a container for beans.
- The Bean factory container allows you to decouple the configuration and specification of dependencies from program logic.
- In the Spring framework, the Bean factory acts as a central IoC container that is responsible for instantiating application objects.
- It also configures and assembles the dependencies between these objects. 
- The XmlBeanFactory class is the most common implementation of the BeanFactory interface. 
- This allows you to express the object to compose your application and remove interdependencies between application objects.

### 2. Spring AOP Module (Aspect Oriented Programming)
- Similar to OOP, which breaks down the applications into hierarchy of objects, AOP breaks down the programs into aspects or concerns.
- The aspects are the regular Spring beans or regular classes annotated with @Aspect annotation.
- These aspects help in transaction management and logging and failure monitoring of an application. i.e
  Transaction management is required in bank operations such as transferring an amount from one account to another 
  Spring AOP module provides a transaction management abstraction layer that can be applied to transaction APIs.

### 3. Spring ORM Module
- The Spring ORM module is used for accessing data from databases in an application. 
- It provides APIs for manipulating databases with JDO, Hibernate, and iBatis.
- Spring ORM supports DAO, which provides a convenient way to build the following DAOs-based ORM solutions:
 * Simple declarative transaction management
 * Transparent exception handling
 * Thread-safe, lightweight template classes
 * DAO support classes
 * Resource management

### 4. Spring Web DAO Module
- The DAO package in the Spring framework provides DAO support by using data access technologies such as JDBC, Hibernate, or JDO.
- This module introduces a JDBC abstraction layer by eliminating the need for providing tedious JDBC coding.
- It also provides programmatic as well as declarative transaction management classes.
- Spring DAO package supports heterogeneous Java Database Connectivity and O/R mapping, 
  which helps Spring work with several data access technologies.
- For easy and quick access to database resources, the Spring framework provides abstract DAO base classes.
- Multiple implementations are available for each data access technology supported by the Spring framework.
- For example, in JDBC, the JdbcDaoSupport class and its methods are used to access the DataSource instance and a preconfigured JdbcTemplate instance. 
- You need to simply extend the JdbcDaoSupport class and provide a mapping to the actual DataSource instance in an application context configuration 
  to access a DAO-based application.

### 5. Spring Web MVC Module
- The Web MVC module of Spring implements the MVC architecture for creating Web applications.
- It separates the code of model and view components of a Web application.
- Explanation (process flow):
  when a request is generated from the browser, it first goes to the DispatcherServlet class (Front Controller),
  which dispatches the request to a controller (SimpleFormController class or AbstractWizardformController class) using a set of handler mappings.
  The controller extracts and processes the information embedded in a request and sends the result to the DispatcherServlet class 
  in the form of the model object.
  Finally, the DispatcherServlet class uses ViewResolver classes to send the results to a view, which displays these results to the users.

### 6. Spring Web Flow Module
- The Spring Web Flow module is an extension of the Spring Web MVC module.
- Spring Web MVC framework provides form controllers, such as class SimpleFormController and AbstractWizardFormController class, 
  to implement predefined workflow. 
- The Spring Web Flow helps in defining XML file or Java Class that manages the workflow between different pages of a Web application.
- Advantages of Spring Web Flow:
  * The flow between different UIs of the application is clearly provided by defining Web flow in XML file.
  * Web flow definitions help you to virtually split an application in different modules and reuse these modules in multiple situations.

### 7. Spring Application Context Module
- The Spring Application context module is based on the Core module.
- Application context org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext is an interface of BeanFactory.
- This module derives its feature from the org.springframework.beans package and also supports functionalities such as 
  internationalization (I18N), validation, event propagation, and resource loading.
- The Application context implements MessageSource interface and provides the messaging functionality to an application.


### Spring Framework Architecture
- Its architecture is designed around two core principles: Dependency Injection (DI) and Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP)
- The Spring framework consists of several modules, which can be categorized into four main areas: 
  * Core Container
  * Data Access/Integration
  * Web
  * Miscellaneous

- The Core Container provides the fundamental functionality of the Spring framework, including the IoC container and ApplicationContext.
- The Data Access/Integration area provides support for integrating with databases and other data sources.
- The Web area provides support for building web applications, including the Spring MVC and Spring WebFlux modules.
- The Miscellaneous area includes other modules that provide additional functionality, such as the Spring Security module for authentication 
  and authorization features.

### Dependency Injection (DI)
- Is a design pattern that helps to reduce the coupling between the components of an application.
- By using DI, the Spring framework enables loose coupling between components, making the application more modular and easier to maintain.
- The Spring framework provides an Inversion of Control (IoC) container, which is responsible for creating and managing instances of JavaBeans, 
  and the ApplicationContext, which provides a unified view of the entire application configuration.

### Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)
- Allows developers to modularize cross-cutting concerns, such as logging, security, and transaction management, 
  and apply them to multiple components of an application. 
- This results in a more modular and reusable codebase.
- Additionally, the Spring frameworkâ€™s flexible configuration model allows developers to configure the application using various approaches, 
  such as XML-based configuration, Java-based configuration, and annotation-based configuration.
