# Prometheus 
Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit used to collect time-series metrics 
from various sources in real-time.
It employs a multi-dimensional data model with labels for efficient querying and analysis.
The tool features PromQL, a powerful query language for extracting insights from the data,
and supports both push and pull data collection models. 
Prometheus allows defining alerting rules to trigger alerts when certain conditions are met, 
and it integrates with a wide range of technologies through its exporter ecosystem.

Prometheus is extensively utilized by DevOps and SRE professionals in Cloud Native environments, 
particularly those leveraging technologies like Docker or Kubernetes,
to comprehensively monitor their entire applications. It relies on two essential components:
* Node Exporter:
  It is designed to collect and expose various system-level metrics from a target node or machine. 
  It runs as a service on the node and provides valuable information about the nodeâ€™s CPU usage, 
  memory consumption, disk utilization, network statistics, and other crucial system-level data. 
  Node Exporter allows Prometheus to scrape these metrics using the pull model and store them as time-series data.
* Alertmanager:
  It is responsible for handling and managing alerts generated by Prometheus based on predefined alerting rules. 
  Alertmanager takes care of deduplicating, grouping, and routing alerts to various alert notification channels like email, 
  Slack, PagerDuty, etc. It ensures that each alert is sent to the right receivers and prevents overwhelming users with redundant notifications.
