# Java Design Patterns

A design pattern is a well-described solution to a common software problem.

### Reasons for Design Patterns

1. Design patterns are already defined and provide an industry-standard approach to solving a recurring problem, 
   so it saves time if we sensibly use the design pattern. There are many Java design patterns that we can use in our Java-based projects.
2. Using design patterns promotes reusability that leads to more robust and highly maintainable code. 
   It helps in reducing the total cost of ownership (TCO) of the software product.
3. Since design patterns are already defined, it makes our code easy to understand and debug. 
   It leads to faster development and new members of the team understand it easily.

Java design patterns are divided into three categories - creational, structural, and behavioral design patterns.

## Creational Design Pattern
