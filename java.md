# Object Programming (OOP) - JAVA

- Java is a popular programming language, created in 1995.

# OOP - Object Oriented Programming
- OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects (real life entities).
  These Objects hold data (properties / attributes) and methods that manipulates the data. 

- Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data, 
  while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.

# Concepts of OOP
- Class:- the blueprint for individual objects, attributes and methods.
- Object:- instances of a class created with specifically defined data.
           correspond to real-world objects or an abstract entity.
- Method:- are functions that objects can perform.
           describe the behaviors of an object.
- 4 main pillars (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, Polymorphism). 
  Others:- Association, Composition, Dependency Injection(DI)
