# SOLID: The First 5 Principles of Object Oriented Design
## Introduction

SOLID is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design (OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin (also known as Uncle Bob).
These principles establish practices for developing software with considerations for maintaining and extending it as the project grows. 
Adopting these practices can also help avoid code smells, refactor code, and develop Agile or Adaptive software.
SOLID stands for:
  * S - Single-responsibility Principle 
  * O - Open-closed Principle
  * L - Liskov Substitution Principle
  * I - Interface Segregation Principle
  * D - Dependency Inversion Principle

### Single-Responsibility Principle

Single-responsibility Principle (SRP) states:
- *A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.*
